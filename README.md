# Sentimental-Analysis-Amazon-Book-Reviews
Sentimental analysis performed on the Amazon book reviews

1) Scrape at least 5000 reviews/blogs from the web using R and then apply the sentiment analysis
technique that you have already learnt
using a downloaded positive/negative lexicon. Stem both lexicon and reviews using openNLP. 
There are many R scraping tools such as rvest. Prepare a labeled dataset.

2) Run SVM, DBN, and CNN in R on the labeled review dataset for sentiment classification 
using deepNet/Darch and MXNet. Your input corresponding to a review is its sparse representation.
